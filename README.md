# Graphic-Board-
 I make a mini project named as GRAPHIC BOARD. I have designed and constructed a basic Drawing application in Python Tkinter GUI, where we can simply draw something on the canvas using a pencil and erase it with an eraser, as well as the ability to change the thickness of a pencil and eraser. We may also modify canvas background color.
